            Verizon 5G Home Internet has many of the same things we like about
            Verizon Fios—fast speeds, no annual contracts, and no data caps.
            Unfortunately, those fast download speeds vary a lot—from 85 Mbps up
            to 1,000 Mbps. But at least Verizon doesn’t offer 5G home internet
            anywhere it deems the speeds too low.
            <br />
            That’s part of why your apartment might be eligible for Verizon 5G
            Home Internet, but your neighbor might not—you get different 5G
            coverage, resulting in varying speeds.

          <h4>Verizon 5G Home vs. 5G Home Plus</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Verizon offers two different packages for its 5G home internet
            service: 5G Home and 5G Home Plus. If you get the 5G Home plan,
            Verizon will cap your bandwidth at 300 Mbps.
            <br />
            But if you shell out another $10 a month for 5G Home Plus, you’ll
            get access to speeds as high as 1,000 Mbps, provided your 5G tower
            has a clear path to your home and the available bandwidth.
            <br />
            Additionally, the 5G Home Plus plan comes with digital storage
            through Verizon Cloud Unlimited and a three-year price guarantee—one
            year longer than 5G Home’s two-year price guarantee.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since Verizon’s 5G home internet speeds and prices vary so much,
            it’s tricky to nail down the bang for your buck—but not impossible.
            Let’s say your address gets a full 300 Mbps from Verizon. Other
            major internet providers offer 300 Mbps plans at anywhere from
            $14.99 to $80.00 a month, with an average of around $50.00 per
            month. So if you get the typical speeds, 5G Home’s price is right
            where it should be—and it’s a steal of a deal if you pair it with a
            Verizon 5G mobile plan.
            <br />
            Additionally, Verizon 5G Home Internet includes equipment for which
            other providers might charge $10 to $15 per month. Those equipment
            savings are a big perk.
            <br />
            In the end, we like Verizon 5G Home Internet a whole bunch, and we
            think you’ll enjoy your experience with it. We just hope you won’t
            run headlong into 5G home internet service just because you think
            you’re guaranteed to get gigabit speeds—your internet will probably
            be slower than that.

          <p className="sect-desc">
            You won’t have to worry about paying for a router with Verizon 5G
            Home Internet because your plan includes a 5G internet gateway. This
            device is part 5G receiver, part router. Verizon designed it to be
            so easy to install that you can set everything up without a
            professional in most cases. The 5G internet gateway usually needs to
            be in a window facing the nearest cell site—that’s how you get your
            5G signal. (Don’t worry, Verizon will provide a map of the best
            places to get a signal in your house.) The gateway will then
            decipher the encoded signal and broadcast it as wireless internet
            throughout your house.
            <br />
            While most internet providers charge about $10 to $15 per month for
            a router, you don’t have to pay a thing for your 5G internet gateway
            from Verizon. So even though your 5G home internet equipment might
            block your view, the savings you’ll get are a nice tradeoff.

          <h4>The future of 5G home internet service</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            You might know 5G is like the previous mobile-technology generation
            4G LTE, but more advanced and capable of faster internet speeds—up
            to 10,000 Mbps, theoretically. That’s faster than any home internet
            on the market.
            <br />
            But right now, 5G home internet providers offer speeds up to only
            1,000 Mbps. The holdup is due in part to the task of updating
            network tech, but US regulations have also limited the frequencies
            5G providers could use.
            <br />
            Things are looking up, though—Verizon took part in an auction with
            the FCC to acquire rights to use mid-band frequencies (the best ones
            for 5G internet). We’re moving beyond the far-carrying-but-slow low
            frequencies and the fast-but-short-reaching high frequencies (that’s
            the millimeter-wave frequencies you’ve heard about).1
            <br />
            As Verizon rolls out the happy medium mid-band frequencies that
            Goldilocks would love, we’re hoping it means more coverage for
            Verizon 5G Home Internet in the future.

          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            While the normal Verizon 5G Home Internet plan is exorbitant for its
            typical speeds, we think the discount Verizon mobile customers get
            is hard to pass up.
            <br />
            And since Verizon 5G Home Internet comes with no annual contract, no
            data caps, and included equipment, we say it’s worth trying out if
            you have the chance. You can always return to landline internet
            plans if 5G internet isn’t for you.

                  Because of 5G’s fast internet speeds, it’s an attractive
                  alternative to landline internet plans. However, 5G signals
                  have a limited range, and you have to be very particular about
                  where you put your 5G home internet modem/router to receive
                  the signal.
                  <br />
                  It’s not so much that 5G can’t do what traditional home
                  internet does—it’s just that 5G is available only in certain
                  parts of select cities. Sometimes, you won’t be able to get 5G

                  position to the nearest cell site.
                  <br />
                  Until there are solutions for all these drawbacks, 5G won’t be
