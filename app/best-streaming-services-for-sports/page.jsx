            Streaming services are finally delivering the sports we desire. But
            there’s a lot to choose from nowadays, so we’ve broken down the top
            services that lay out the best channel and league offerings for
            sports fans. <br />
            YouTube TV is our go-to overall pick because the live TV streaming
            service offers essential ESPN and FOX Sports networks on top of
            league-specific channels and NFL Sunday Ticket. If you want to
            upgrade an existing TV plan, ESPN+ has a wide range of league
            coverage, while Peacock offers an inexpensive mix of sports and
            entertainment. <br />
            Of course, there are several services to consider—each offering a
            unique lineup of channels and leagues. So keep scrolling to see how
            each compares and why you might choose one over another.

            If you want a solid blend of sports and entertainment, YouTube
            TV offers the best of both worlds. You’ll get 100+ live channels,
            including popular non-sport favorites like AMC, Comedy Central,
            Disney Channel, and Syfy. With a sleek and familiar interface,
            YouTube TV is an excellent service overall, which is why it’s
            our favorite live TV streaming service at CableTV.com. <br />
            From a sports perspective, YouTube TV doesn’t have as many sports
            channels as DIRECTV STREAM or Fubo. But it has the important ones
            and is the new home of NFL Sunday Ticket—making it the best service
            to watch NFL games. The included cloud DVR has no limits but deletes
            recordings after nine months. It’s excellent for keeping up on games
            when you have a busy schedule. Plus, it has a score-hiding function
            to avoid spoilers. <br />
            ​​Unfortunately, none of those games you record will come from MLB
            Network or NHL Network. (Sorry, baseball and hockey fans. YouTube TV
            doesn’t carry those channels.) Still, YouTube TV gives you a lot of
            sports and entertainment networks for $72.99/mo.

          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            We say ESPN+ offers the best value for streaming sports because it
            has the most league coverage out of any service and costs only
            $10.99/mo. or $109.99/yr. ESPN+ includes games from every major
            sports league in the United States, except for the NBA. It has every
            out-of-market NHL game, every XFL matchup, and expanded golf
            coverage via PGA Tour Live. And the buck doesn’t stop
            there—especially for soccer fans—as ESPN+ is the exclusive U.S.
            broadcast partner for the Bundesliga and La Liga. Basically, you’ll
            never run out of live sports to watch on ESPN+. <br />
            The service also has an extensive library of on-demand shows and
            documentary series focused on the world of sports. This includes the
            entire 30 for 30 library and Man in the Arena with Tom Brady. <br />
            While ESPN+ doesn’t grant you access to ESPN’s traditional channels
            and programming, you can always pair the service with a TV provider
            to get the complete ESPN experience. The simplest way of doing this
            is to sign up for Hulu + Live TV because it carries the ESPN
            networks and comes with ESPN+ at no extra cost.

            Being a sports fan can be expensive, but luckily you can save a lot
            of money with Peacock and still watch some of the biggest sporting
            events in the world. <br />
            Peacock no longer offers a free plan to new subscribers, so we
            recommend Peacock Premium Monthly to get access to every sporting
            event offered. And it’s really an impressive lineup of
            sports—including the English Premier League, MLB, the PGA Tour,
            and WWE . . . a lot of WWE. <br />
            Apart from sports, Peacock Premium Monthly also includes next-day
            access to NBC shows and an impressive library of hit movies. The
            latest movies from Universal Pictures usually find their way to
            Peacock a few months after their initial theatrical release.

            Hulu + Live TV offers the smallest amount of sports channels. While
            it includes the basics like ESPN, FOX Sports, and NBC Sports
            networks, it misses out on league-specific channels like MLB
            Network, NBA TV, and NHL Network.
            <br />
            Like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV makes up for its sports shortcomings
            with its other features. In fact, it has the best original on-demand
            content out of all the live TV streaming services. And we’re not
            just talking about Hulu Originals—Hulu + Live TV
            includes Disney+ and ESPN+ at no extra cost. That’s a major plus in
            our book, especially considering the amount of sports content
            available on ESPN+ alone.

            <span> Best channel add-ons: </span> Sling TV
          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            Sling TV offers three base plan options. But to get the most sports
            channels, you’d want the priciest one ($55 a month) with an add-on
            sports package ($15 a month). It involves a little more thinking and
            math—we know, not cool—but Sling TV can stream almost all the sports
            you can handle. Sling Orange (30+ channels) and Sling Blue (40+
            channels) aren’t terrible individually, but the combined Sling
            Orange & Blue plan nets you mainstream sports channels like ESPN and
            FS1. Combined with 20 more sports networks from Sling TV’s Sports
            Extra add-on, that’s over 30 sports channels for $65 a month. <br />
            Of course, you may not be interested in all of the channels in the
            $65-a-month option, in which case you might want to downsize to
            either the Sling Orange or Sling Blue plan alone. That would only be
            $40 a month, making it the cheapest live TV streaming option for
            sports. And hey, with Sling Orange or Sling Blue, you can still tack
            on their own individualized Sports Extra packages. Sling TV is
            nothing if not customizable. <br />
            The major downside with Sling TV is that it includes only 50 hours
            of cloud DVR space, which you can upgrade to 200 hours for an extra
            $5 a month. Good luck recording more than a handful of sports events
            with that allotment. We hope you’re not into NASCAR.

            While DIRECTV STREAM may be the streaming version of DIRECTV, you’ll
            need its CHOICE™ plan or higher to get the best experience. At
            $84.99 a month, the CHOICE plan is one of the most expensive plans
            among our top sports streaming picks. But it comes with the best
            regional sports and local coverage of any live TV streaming service.
            <br />
            Those regional sports networks (RSNs) make DIRECTV STREAM shine the
            most. Only Fubo has as many RSNs as DIRECTV STREAM, but Fubo lacks
            core channels like TBS, TNT, and truTV. That makes DIRECTV STREAM a
            crucial service for cord-cutters seeking local and national MLB,
            NBA, and NHL coverage.

          <p className="after-heading">
            RSNs give you in-market games that don’t air nationally. If you want
            to avoid local blackouts, we recommend checking out DIRECTV’s
            free RSN lookup tool to see which RSNs are available in your area.
            That’ll help you determine if DIRECTV STREAM is really worth it.

            <span> Best free trial: </span> Fubo
          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            If you’re willing to pay for it, Fubo (formerly fuboTV) can give you
            more sports channels than most live TV streaming services. This
            includes some channels you may have never heard of—unless you’re
            really into soccer. While Fubo launched as a fútbol-centric
            streaming service, its channel offerings now include entertainment
            networks and custom add-on options. Unfortunately, Fubo doesn’t
            carry core Warner Bros. Discovery networks. You won’t see channels
            like TBS, TNT, and truTV in any Fubo plan. It’s a significant loss
            because TNT carries a lot of nationally televised NBA and NHL games,
            while TBS airs many MLB games. You can also say goodbye to watching
            most of March Madness.
            <br />
            Our recommendation: If you’re a diehard soccer fan, you’ll want the
            Elite plan ($84.99 a month) with the International Sports Plus
            add-on ($6.99 a month). Together, the plan and the add-on will give
            you access to some of the top soccer leagues in the world through
            channels like beIN SPORTS, GolTV English, and FOX Soccer Plus.
            That’s a lot of fútbol to keep your retinas busy, but now the
            monthly price tag is $91.98 a month.

            Paramount+ has some great original series like Star Trek:
            Picard and 1883, but the streaming service excels most in its
            handling of live sports. In order to get the most live sports
            coverage, though, you’ll first need the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME
            plan ($11.99 a month). <br />
            With the higher-tier plan, you’ll be able to watch live SHOWTIME
            content and your local CBS affiliate within the Paramount+ app. This
            expands the app’s already strong roster of live sports, giving you
            complete access to NFL on CBS, Bellator MMA, Serie A, and UEFA
            Champions League broadcasts. <br />
            College basketball also runs rampant on Paramount+, but you’ll want
            to check out our How To Watch College Basketball guide for the
            complete lowdown on that.

            <br />
            You can also take your Prime Video experience to the next level with
            its wide selection of sports add-on channels, including NBA League

            <br />
            For now, live sports are somewhat limited on Apple TV+. But the

            content from popular Spanish-language networks like Galavisión,
            TUDN, UniMás, and Univision. Plus, you’ll see exclusives that don’t
            appear anywhere else.
            <br />
            Sports fans will benefit the most from ViX’s daily dose of live
            events—from Liga MX and UEFA competitions to Argentine Primera
            División and Liga Mexicana de Beisbol games. It also doesn’t hurt if
            you’re a telenovela aficionado because ViX comes packed with Spanish

            DAZN is one of the best streaming services for combat

            It also has UEFA Women’s Champions League (UWCL) matches
            alongside niche sports like pool, darts, chess, and snooker.
            <br />
            The biggest downside to DAZN is its price. At $24.99 a month, you’d
            expect the service to include a deep library of mainstream sports.
            The price is incredibly disappointing if you’re interested only in
            specific leagues like the UWCL. Plus, PPV fees still exist for
            select combat events.

            After finding your favorite sports and leagues, the next most

            Most of the services highlighted in this article are widely
            available across major streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV, Apple
            TV, and Roku. Still, it’s always worth double-checking your device’s

          <h4>DVR specs and on-demand content</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            With live TV streaming services, you’ll want to make sure the amount
            of cloud DVR space available to you meets your needs. Sports with
            events or games that occur several times a week can easily crowd
            your DVR. If your daily schedule makes it difficult to watch sports
            live, you’ll want to ensure you choose a live TV streaming service
            with adequate space.
            <br />
            YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV are the very best for recording live
            TV. The two services have unlimited DVR space; recordings stay
            active for up to nine months.
            <br />
            On-demand streaming services like ESPN+, Peacock,
            and Paramount+ don’t offer DVR options. Because of their on-demand
            nature, each service automatically stores most live events for a
            certain duration of time. For example, Premier League matches on
            Peacock are available to stream for 30 days after they air.

          <h4> Methodology</h4>
          <p>
            Our sports-obsessed experts spent over 1,000 hours testing live TV
            streaming services to determine the best ones for watching sports.
            We compared both overall and sport-specific channel lineups and
            examined what kind of league coverage each service’s channel lineups
            encompass. We also looked at TV plans, prices, and extra features,
            as well as the technical specifications of every service.
