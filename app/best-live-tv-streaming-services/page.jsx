            We’ve named YouTube TV our best overall live TV streaming service
            because of its excellent channel lineup, unlimited DVR, and smooth

            fantastic on-demand library—the best of both worlds.

            YouTube TV, YouTube’s live TV streaming service, combines the most
            familiar interface on the planet with an impressive array of
            entertainment, sports, and add-on channels. All hail our new Google
            overlords! <br />
            We’ve named YouTube TV our best overall live TV streaming service
            because of its ease of use, superior performance, and fat channel
            lineup. It’s a little more expensive than most of the others, but we
            think it’s worth the price. <br />
            Meanwhile, upsides to YouTube TV include unlimited cloud DVR storage
            that keeps recorded shows for up to nine months. YouTube TV’s search
            function is also among the best in live TV streaming, thanks to its
            Google integration.

            regional sports channels, in addition to NFL Network and NBA TV.{" "}
            <br />
            But there are some holes in YouTube TV’s entertainment channel
            lineup. It lacks channels like A&E, Lifetime, and VICE. What is life
            without The First 48, Married at First Sight, or wall-to-wall F*ck,
            That’s Delicious episodes? We’re asking for a friend. <br />
            YouTube TV’s recent price hikes irked customers as well, even though
            they also gained over a dozen new channels—including Comedy Central,
            Paramount Network, and BET. In 2021, TeenNick, MTV2, MTV Classic,
            and three more were added to YouTube TV, pushing the channel count
            to over 100 in some markets. <br />
            We think YouTube TV is the complete package when it comes to live TV
            streaming, hence our best overall ranking. <br />

          <h4> Hulu + Live TV: Best value</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            When you think of Hulu, you probably think of The Handmaid’s Tale—or
            maybe Palm Springs if you’re into romantic quantum time-travel
            comedies. <br />
            Beyond original dystopian dramas, thinky comedies, and next-day
            broadcast releases, Hulu has also taken a swing at live TV streaming
            with its imaginatively titled Hulu + Live TV. Despite the name, the
            crew here at CableTV.com likes it so much we’ve named it our best
            value streamer.
            <br />
            For $76.99–$89.99/mo., in addition to on-demand Hulu content, Hulu +
            Live TV gives you over 75 live cable channels and, depending on your
            area, a near-complete local network lineup.

            As a bonus, both Hulu + Live TV plans include the Disney+/ESPN+
            bundle to take the sting out of the high price. <br />
            That all sounds good until you scan the cable channels and notice
            favorites like AMC, IFC, and BBC America are nowhere to be found.
            Other streaming services lack these channels, too—we recommend
            making up the difference with Philo, which carries them all for just
            $25 a month.
            <br />
            Sports fans, on the other hand, are treated to ESPN, ESPN2, FS1,
            FS2, and NFL Network, plus TBS and TNT, with Hulu + Live TV. It also
            offers a generous number of regional sports networks and a handful
            of college sports channels. However, MLB, NBA, and NHL pro sports
            networks are missing.
            <br />
            Hulu + Live TV’s cloud DVR affords you unlimited storage space and
            will keep your recorded shows for nine months (just as YouTube TV
            does). It’s a nice feature, but Hulu + Live TV still only allows two
            simultaneous streams.
            <br />
            Still, we think Hulu + Live TV provides the best live TV streaming
            value for the price. Access to all of that cool Hulu on-demand
            content (including the FX originals library, which is like a premium
            add-on in and of itself) seals the deal.

          <h4>Philo: Cheapest</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Don’t care about sports or local channels? Philo—named after
            television inventor Philo T. Farnsworth—might be the budget live TV
            streaming answer for you.
            <br />
            There’s only one Philo package, which carries over 60 channels for
            $25 a month. It includes A&E, AMC, BBC America, Comedy Central,
            Discovery, Food Network, HGTV, VICE, and Hallmark, among many
            others.
            <br />
            You might recognize some of those as the popular channels missing
            from other live TV streaming services. So what gives?
            <br />
            By connecting the red conspiracy strings on the corkboard, you’ll
            find Philo is co-owned by the four major media companies that also
            own the channels usually absent from other live TV streaming
            services. With a few exceptions, those companies keep their channels
            exclusive to Philo for live TV streaming. An inconvenient situation,
            for sure.
            <br />
            The very things that keep Philo’s subscription rate low are also its
            biggest minuses: you can’t stream local channels or sports. Both
            those channel types are expensive to carry, so Philo decided to be
            the outlier among live TV streaming services and just go with
            lifestyle and entertainment channels. If you want more than that,
            you’ll have to sign up for a second live TV streamer or buy an HD
            antenna.
            <br />
            If you like recording and hoarding your favorite shows, however, get
            this: Philo’s cloud DVR will store your unlimited recordings for a
            full year, three months longer than even YouTube TV. So you can take
            your time analyzing those Ancient Aliens episodes.
            <br />
            Compared to live TV streaming apps like Hulu + Live TV and YouTube
            TV, Philo is a bare-bones affair—but for only $25 a month, there’s
            still plenty to like about the service.

              Philo is best for budget-bound households where a low monthly

              sports or local channels.
            </p>
            <h4>Want live news and sports?</h4>
            <p>
              Well, Philo ain’t for you then, but there’s still hope. Sling
              TV is also very cheap ($40.00–$55.00/mo.) and comes with a bigger
              variety of channels, including ESPN and CNN. <br />
              What’s more, Sling TV packages are a lot cheaper than almost every
              other live TV streaming service and most cable TV packages. <br />
              You can also add channel packs at a reasonable price to customize
              your Sling TV package and get more of the live entertainment you
              want. Check out our Sling TV channels guide for more information.

          <h4>Fubo: Best free trial</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Fubo (formerly fuboTV) promises “live sports and TV without cable,”
            delivering “the perfect mix of sports and entertainment.” It’s an
            expansion on the service’s initial mission to be “the Netflix of
            soccer,” which still fits.
            <br />
            The Fubo Pro package, at $74.99 a month, offers 150+ live TV
            streaming channels, including entertainment staples like FX, AMC,
            Syfy, and Comedy Central. The Elite plan, $84.99 a month, adds over
            30 more channels to the mix.
            <br />
            Fubo’s Premier plan, at $94.99 a month, nets you 220+ channels,
            including Paramount+ with SHOWTIME. It also comes with a DVR upgrade
            to 1,000 hours. For a beyond-complete live TV streaming experience,
            Premier is the way to go.
            <br />
            Even with the addition of ESPN channels, Fubo’s niche sports
            programming is where it’s at, especially if you’re really,
            really, really into soccer (you know who you are). That impressive
            channel count is mostly soccer networks that even hardcore fans
            might not recognize. And, with Fubo’s sports add-on packages, you
            can get even more.
            <br />
            Around the same time, Fubo added ESPN channels, making it a sports
            powerhouse, it lost a suite of WarnerMedia channels: TBS, TNT, CNN,
            CNN International, CNN en Español, HLN, Cartoon Network/Adult Swim,
            Turner Classic Movies, truTV, and Boomerang. That’s a serious chunk
            of missing entertainment.
            <br />
            Fubo is also an expensive live TV streamer, with nearly the same
            monthly cost as a cable or satellite subscription. You get a lot
            with Fubo, but you’ll definitely pay for it.

          <h4>Sling TV: Best deals</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            In terms of interface and channel options, Sling TV is similar to
            Hulu + Live TV. Its basic plans are cheaper if somewhat confusing,
            but overall Sling TV is highly customizable with multiple available
            add-on packages—including one for the kiddies.
            <br />
            The Sling Orange (32 channels for $40 a month) and Sling Blue (40
            channels, also for $40 a month) packages aren’t bad for casual TV
            viewers. But more demanding viewers will likely want Sling Orange +
            Blue (46 channels for $55 a month) since it’s the most complete
            basic, no ad-ons package Sling TV has to offer.
            <br />
            The Orange + Blue package has kids’ channels Cartoon Network, Disney
            Channel, and Nick Jr. For $6 more a month, you can add the Kids
            Extra package, which includes Disney Junior, Disney XD, Nick Jr.,
            Nicktoons, TeenNick, Boomerang, BabyTV, and DuckTV.
            <br />
            Sling TV’s cable channel lineup is strong—and with add-on packages,
            it gets even better, especially for sports (mom and dad need some to
            watch, too). If you have the patience to navigate the color coding,
            Sling TV is a solid service.
            <br />
            Of course, like other live TV streaming services reviewed here,
            Sling TV doesn’t have everything. Local channels are lacking; many
            markets get only FOX or NBC affiliates. And figuring out Sling TV’s
            local coverage requires more than a glance, unfortunately. At least
            Sling TV is proactive about helping customers use antennas to get
            local channels by offering several deals on the equipment.
            <br />
            But Sling’s TV’s rotating monthly deals and add-on channel package
            options—there are over 30 of them—should grab the attention of
            customizers who like to tweak their TV lineups to their own tastes
            and save a little cash along the way.

              well-rounded TV experience possible at a nice price.
            </p>
            <h4>Sling TV device compatibility</h4>
            <p>
              Sling TV is available on AirTV Player, Amazon Fire TV, Android

          <h4>DIRECTV STREAM: Most sports channels</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Like many legacy media providers, DIRECTV leaped into the streaming
            boom quickly. After several iterations, DIRECTV STREAM (formerly
            AT&T TV) has since evolved into a decent streaming version of its
            satellite TV service, complete with unlimited cloud DVR—but it’s not
            cheap.
            <br />
            DIRECTV STREAM looks and navigates much like its satellite TV
            counterpart. More importantly, it also carries more RSNs (regional
            sports networks) than most other live TV streaming services, like
            Bally Sports, YES, MASN, Altitude, and ROOT Sports.
            <br />
            In the negative column, DIRECTV STREAM is pricey and suggests you
            rent its proprietary set-top box to operate (though apps are
            available for devices like Roku and Amazon Fire TV). That’s a very
            satellite move.
            <br />
            But, if you’re determined to sidestep contracts, ditch the dish
            (scraping snow off a satellite receiver in the dead of winter
            sucks—we feel you), and keep your RSNs, DIRECTV STREAM is a
            relatively painless gateway into the world of full-time streaming
            TV. It’s no bargain, though—prepare your wallet for a hit.

          <h4>Vidgo: 100+ channels</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            The relatively new Vidgo is a live TV streaming service that carries
            110–250+ channels for $69.99–$99.99/mo. It also has an exclusive
            “Social TV” chatroom where you can interact with like-minded TV fans
            on the service and a Spanish-only plan option.
            <br />
            Vidgo is mostly about sports and family programming, featuring a
            full suite of Disney-owned channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, Disney
            Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, and more. It also carries the Hallmark
            Channel, Lifetime, and beIN Sports—channels that are hard to come by
            in streaming.
            <br />
            While Vidgo gives you 110–250+ channels to stream, there are several
            popular channels—like TBS, TNT, Syfy, Bravo, and USA Network—missing
            from its lineup.
            <br />
            Besides not featuring popular WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal channels,
            Vidgo has limited on-demand capabilities and a terrible Cloud DVR
            upgrade available with select plans.
            <br />
            But, as a viewing experience, Vidgo is simple and streamlined
            (especially for mobile viewing). If you don’t need a fat array of
            channels or a lot of Cloud DVR storage, it’s a decent deal.

          <h4>Frndly TV: Good skinny bundle</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Frndly TV (or “Friendly”) is a live TV streaming service aimed at
            older viewers and families on a budget. It carries 40+ live
            channels, but only 10 we’d consider essential: A&E, HISTORY,
            Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network, fyi, VICE, Hallmark Channel,
            Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, Hallmark Drama, and The Weather
            Channel. The rest is, well, filler.
            <br />
            The upside: Frndly TV’s most expensive Premium plan is just $10.99 a
            month, which comes out to around $1.00 apiece for those popular
            channels. The Premium and Classic ($8.99 a month) plans also include
            unlimited cloud DVR storage (for three months), while the Basic plan
            gives you live and on-demand programming from the same 30 channels
            for a dirt-cheap $6.99 a month.
            <br />
            Due to its limited channel count and lack of local and sports
            channels (Outdoor Channel and Sportsman Channel are about as sporty
            as Frndly TV gets), we don’t think Frndly TV competes against our
            editorial pick for cheapest live TV streaming service, Philo. But,
            if its 10 core popular channels are all you want, Frndly TV is worth
            taking for a free seven-day trial spin.

            One of the ever-so-wonderful perks of streaming TV services is the
            free trial period. Unlike cable or satellite, streaming TV services
            don’t have installation appointments or contracts, so taking a
            service for a spin is simple and costs nothing. The trial windows
            are brief (usually seven days) but adequate.{" "}

          <p className="after-heading">
            Most streaming TV services that offer live TV also include cloud DVR
            storage with the package. Like a physical DVR, though, they do have
            limits on space and time. Some give you as little as 10 hours, while
            some “unlimited” options will save your Hoarders episodes backlog
            for only a few months. Ironic.{" "}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="package-table-container channels">
          <h4> Does the service carry local channels?</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            You may not think about local channels much, but they carry the
            shows you love live from ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS, and The CW. If a
            streaming TV service doesn’t carry local affiliate channels, you
            could miss out on those shows, as well as area sports, news, and
            weather.
            <br />
            If these are important to you, check the availability of local
            affiliates on streaming TV services you’re interested in. If they’re
            not available, a digital antenna can make up the difference.

            on your preferred set-top box or mobile devices? Most services
            reviewed here are available as smart TV apps, though we
            recommend streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Google

          <p className="sect-desc">
            For overall channel inclusion, features, and performance, we
            think Youtube TV is more than worth its $72.99/mo. price tag—it’s
            the Cadillac (or Tesla, if you prefer) of live TV streaming
            services. Hulu + Live TV is a close second, and a great value when
            you factor in access to regular Hulu.
            <br />
            Philo is obviously the cheapest live TV streaming service, even
            though it does have some shortcomings. On the other end of the price
            spectrum, Fubo is a killer service for foreign sports fans,
            and DIRECTV STREAM has its perks, too—namely, fat channel lineups
            and RSNs. At $69.99–$99.99/mo., channel-loaded newbie live TV
            streamer Vidgo is also worth a look.
