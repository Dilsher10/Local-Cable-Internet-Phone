            Hulu offers next-day TV episodes and some great original content,
            but is it worth adding to your streaming lineup? CableTV.com’s

            For $7.99 a month (with ads) or $17.99 a month (ad-free), Hulu is
            still one of the least expensive streaming services and one of the
            most essential to have in your app lineup, in our opinion.
            <br />
            It doesn’t carry the same overwhelming volume of content as Netflix
            or Prime Video, but Hulu’s exclusive next-day streaming of broadcast
            and cable shows is a major advantage over the other services. Throw
            in its expanding collection of quality original content, and Hulu
            remains a good deal for the price (which tends to increase on the
            regular—watch this space).
            <br />
            Hulu’s on-demand streaming library includes over 40,000 movies and
            TV episodes, including next-day streaming of new episodes of series
            from FOX, ABC, NBC, FX, FXX, and more. Hulu also has its own slate
            of original shows, like Only Murders in the Building, The Dropout,
            Pam & Tommy, How I Met Your Father, and The Handmaid’s Tale.
            <br />
            You can also add live TV channels to Hulu, which we cover in our
            Hulu + Live TV review.

          <h4>Hulu free trials and deals </h4>
          <p>
            Hulu offers a 30-day free trial, as well as several money-saving
            deals. Read all about them in our Hulu Deals guide. <br />
            The biggest Hulu deal is the Disney bundle, which comes in three
            flavors: Duo Basic ($9.99 a month for Hulu and Disney+, both with
            ads), Trio Basic ($14.99 a month for Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+, all
            with ads), and Trio Premium ($24.99 a month for Hulu, Disney+, and
            ESPN+, only ESPN+ has ads).

          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            The basic, ad-supported Hulu plan is a bargain at $7.99 a month—but,
            if you can swing it, we recommend the ad-free Hulu plan at $17.99 a
            month. That’s about as expensive as most of the nearest competition,
            as you’ll see below, but that extra cash is worth your
            commercial-free sanity, in our opinion.

          <p className="sect-desc">
            Since it’s our favorite plan, we’ll use the $12.99-a-month ad-free
            Hulu tier for apples-to-apples (or oranges-to-oranges if you prefer)
            streaming comparison. <br />
            We think Hulu’s combo of next-day content, original programming, and
            its catalog of TV shows and movies make it a strong contender
            against Netflix and Max (formerly HBO Max). It probably won’t
            replace either in your streaming app collection, but it’s an
            excellent supplement.

            Hulu streams the latest episodes of shows from fellow Disney-owned
            networks (ABC, FOX, FX, FXX, Freeform, and others) 24 hours or
            sooner after their broadcast/cable premieres. Hulu used to do the
            same for some NBC series but, as corporate synergy demands, next-day
            streaming rights to those shows moved to NBCUniversal-owned Peacock
            in fall 2022. We keep mentioning Hulu’s next-day streaming of
            broadcast and cable show episodes for a reason: no other on-demand
            service but Peacock does it, and it’s great for cord-cutters who
            have zero interest in paying for a live TV provider just to watch
            the latest Bob’s Burgers (gotta keep up on those “Burger of the Day”
            gags).
            <br />
            Hulu’s ever-growing collection of original series, movies,
            documentaries, and kids’ shows is nothing to overlook, either. The
            award-winning The Handmaid’s Tale is Hulu’s most well-known
            original, but recent hits like Only Murders in the Building, The
            Dropout, Pam & Tommy, How I Met Your Father, and Reservation Dogs
            have also put a shine on the in-house Hulu brand. We’ve compiled a
            few lists of acquired shows and Hulu originals we think are worth
            checking out on our What to Watch on Hulu guide.
            <br />
            Max, CINEMAX, SHOWTIME, and STARZ are available to add to Hulu
            plans; EPIX is not. Of course, Disney+ and ESPN+ are also available
            to bundle with Hulu.

            Final take: <span> Is Hulu worth it?</span>
          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            We think Hulu is an essential subscription for your on-demand app
            lineup, whether you go with the $7.99 version with ads or the $17.99
            ad-free plan (our pick). You can even try it out for a whole month
            at no cost—we’re big fans of free trials. Hulu offers unique value
            as a streaming service in that it curates next-day content from
            outside broadcast and cable channels, carries recent movies,
            produces its own original content, and offers the option to add live
            TV channels with Hulu + Live TV. Even with recent price hikes, we
            still think Hulu is a great value.
            <br />
            But, as much as we like Hulu’s features, originals, and pricing (not
            to mention the availability of the Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ bundle),
            we’re still hung up on those measly two streams. We’d call this a
            Mickey Mouse deal from parent company Disney, but it would be a
            little too on-the-nose.

          <h4>Methodology:</h4>
          <p>
            Our TV experts spent hundreds of hours testing and evaluating Hulu,
            rating the service on value, reliability, features, and customer
            satisfaction. Then we matched Hulu up against other premium
            streaming TV services head-to-head to give a clearer picture of its
            strengths and weaknesses. For more information on our methodology,
