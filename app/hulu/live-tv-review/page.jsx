            With 85+ live channels and Hulu’s massive library of on-demand TV
            shows, movies, and originals, Hulu + Live TV is a great value.

          <h4>Is Hulu + Live TV good?</h4>
          <p>
            Hulu + Live TV is exactly what the name implies: live tv streaming
            (like Sling TV or Philo) added to on-demand Hulu. Combined, Hulu +
            Live TV is an excellent value because you get access to the Hulu
            catalog of content and the most popular live TV streaming service in
            the country (we think YouTube TV does it better, but Hulu + Live TV
            is a close second).
            <br />
            Hulu + Live TV is one of the more expensive live TV streaming
            services, but it also features a husky count of popular channels
            (85+) and a wide range of available deals and discounts. Sweetening
            the deal, Hulu + Live TV also includes the so-hot-now Hulu bundle
            with Disney+ and ESPN+, as well as unlimited cloud DVR storage space
            for recorded shows.
            <br />
            Besides its higher price, the only other downsides to Hulu + Live TV
            are a handful of favorite channels missing from its live TV lineup
            (like AMC, BBC America, and IFC) and its simultaneous streams
            allowance (just two). Still, it’s one of the best live TV streaming
            services out there—let’s explore why.

            As of December 2021, both the ad-supported and ad-free Hulu + Live
            TV plans include Disney+ (regularly $7.99 a month) and ESPN+
            (regularly $10.99 a month) bundled at no extra charge.

            We prefer the No Ads plan with Hulu on-demand, and the same goes for
            Hulu + Live TV. But keep in mind that only the on-demand side of
            Hulu is commercial-free. You’ll still get ad breaks while watching
            live TV channels; they’re as unavoidable as taxes and Batman movies.
            If you can afford Hulu + Live TV (No Ads) at $89.99 a month, we say
            it’s worth it—life’s too short for excess commercials.

            Hulu + Live TV is most comparable to YouTube TV and Fubo these days,
            offering a lot of channels and cloud DVR space at a higher monthly
            price than slimmer live TV streaming services like Sling TV and
            Philo. However, Hulu + Live TV still has the advantage of being

          <p>
            Hulu + Live TV’s channel lineup is impressive, but not without a few
            holes. Popular channels AMC, BBC America, and IFC are missing from
            Hulu + Live TV’s 75+ channel collection, as are sports channels like
            NBA TV, MLB Network, and NHL Network.
            <br />

            The big news here: Hulu + Live TV recently upped its cloud DVR
            storage space to unlimited (it’ll keep your recorded shows for nine
            months, as YouTube TV does).
            <br />
            That’s a nice improvement over the previously included 50 hours and
            extra-charge 200 hours, and you can now skip commercials on recorded
            live TV. Unlimited storage only seems unusable until you realize how
            quickly 12 seasons of Bob’s Burgers can pile up (that’s over 100
            hours of hamburger puns, FYI).

          <h4>Simultaneous streams</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Hulu + Live TV allows only two simultaneous streams between TVs,
            tablets, phones, and computers. This is one of our few complaints
            about the service—a third stream seems so doable, so why not just do
            it already? All of the other live TV streaming services offer at
            least three.
            <br />
            For an additional monthly $9.99, you can upgrade to unlimited
            simultaneous Hulu + Live TV streams. That’ll get you watching on
            multiple TVs and up to three mobile screens—as long as they’re all
            on the same home Wi-Fi network.

          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            Our favorite live TV streaming service at CableTV.com is still
            YouTube TV, but Hulu + Live TV has plenty going for it—especially
            after the recent additions of the included Disney+/ESPN+ bundle and
            unlimited cloud DVR storage.
            <br />
            Hulu + Live TV is also unique in that it comes with an excellent
            built-in on-demand service (Hulu, of course). If YouTube TV suddenly
            disappeared (perish the thought), we’d jump to Hulu + Live TV in a
            second—even if we had to put up with just two streams and no AMC.
            The pluses far outweigh the minuses here.

          <h4>Methodology:</h4>
          <p>
            Our TV experts spent hundreds of hours testing and evaluating Hulu,
            rating the service on value, reliability, features, and customer
            satisfaction. Then we matched Hulu up against other premium
            streaming TV services head-to-head to give a clearer picture of its
            strengths and weaknesses. For more information on our methodology,
