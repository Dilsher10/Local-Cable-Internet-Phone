            InternetÂ®, TV, and phone service, youâ€™ll still get the convenience
            of paying one bill instead of having to juggle three different
            provider contracts every month. Whether youâ€™re a new or existing
            Spectrum customer, you can bundle your services at any time.

          <p>
            As of September 11, 2023, the carrier dispute between Charter
            Communications and Disney has been resolved. Spectrum TV customers
            once again have access to Disney-owned channels like ESPN, Disney
            Channel, and ABC. Spectrum TV Select customers will also receive
            subscriptions to the ad-supported Disney+ plan in the near future,
            while Spectrum TV Select Plus customers will gain access to ESPN+.

            (wireless speeds may vary), the Spectrum Internet package is best
            for small households who stream TV and work from home. With its
            faster maximum download and upload speeds, Spectrum Internet Ultra
            and Spectrum Internet Gig comfortably handle regular streaming video
            or video calls from a larger four to six-person family.
            <br />
            Although Spectrumâ€™s Internet packages are pricey compared to other
            nationwide ISPs, the provider offers no contract agreements and a
            FREE modem, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about equipment rental
            surcharges. But after 12 months, your monthly bill will go up by
            $25.00 for all three plans.

          <p className="after-heading">
            Although you canâ€™t get landline phone service by itself from
            Spectrum, Spectrumâ€™s phone bundles are still around $30 less than
            its two-service packages. If you want home phone service but not
            necessarily cable TV and internet, snag one of Spectrumâ€™s home phone
            and cable TV or internet and phone packages.
            <br />
            Since you can upgrade internet packages during the checkout process,
            weâ€™d recommend Internet + Voice if youâ€™re looking for a Spectrum
            Voice bundle. Spectrumâ€™s 300 Mbps (wireless speeds may vary) plan is
            fine if you use the internet only for basic web browsing, or you can
            upgrade to Spectrumâ€™s 500 Mbps or 1 Gbps** (wireless speeds may
            vary) plans for better download speeds.

            The standalone package includes networks such as TeleFÃ³rmula, CNN en
            EspaÃ±ol, and BeIN SPORTS EspaÃ±ol.
            <br />
            If youâ€™re getting service for a bilingual household, the Mi Plan
            Latino phone, internet, and internet bundle covers all of your
            bases. With the plan, youâ€™ll get English- and Spanish-language TV
            channels, plus Spectrum Voice, which includes unlimited calls to
            Mexico and Puerto Rico.

          <p className="after-heading">
            For most customers, weâ€™d recommend springing for a TV and internet
            bundle. With Spectrum TV, youâ€™ll get basic cable channels like CNN
            and HGTV thatâ€™ll give everyone in the family something to watch.
            <br />
            For households that need landline phone service, weâ€™d recommend a
            three-service bundle. If youâ€™re interested in cable TV service, weâ€™d
            also recommend adding additional channel packs to your TV plan.
