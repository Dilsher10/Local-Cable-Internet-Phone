            the perks we look for in an internet service provider. But when you

            second-year price increases aren’t great for customers.

            is Spectrum’s entry-level offering with a maximum download speed of
            up to 300 Mbps (wireless speeds may vary).
            <br />
            The entry-level package isn’t bad, especially considering Spectrum
            just raised its speed up from 200 Mbps without changing the price.
            This package can be a potential fit for a family of moderate
            internet users, especially if you’re working from home.
            <br />

            offers even faster performance with maximum download speeds of up to
            500 Mbps (wireless speeds may vary).
            <br />
            If we had to choose, we’d pick Spectrum Internet 500 Mbps as the
            best Spectrum Internet package. With its high speeds, your internet
            connections will remain just as fast even if you have kids or
            housemates who regularly stream TV shows or game online, and it’s a
            more affordable option than Spectrum Internet Gig.

              <Link href={"#"}>Spectrum’s top-tier Internet Gig package</Link>
            </span>{" "}
            comes with maximum download speeds of up to 1 Gbps** (wireless
            speeds may vary). With Spectrum gig internet service, your internet
            performance won’t collapse if your household has multiple people who
            regularly stream 4K videos, download large files, and take lengthy
            video calls.
            <br />
            On all three speed tiers, your monthly price will increase by $25
            once Spectrum’s one-year promotional rate ends. Even though a lot of
            ISPs have similar fine print, we’re still not fans of the one-year
            price hike. We recommend marking down your promo price end date to
            make sure you’re not surprised, or try negotiating with Spectrum to
            bring your price back down.
            <br />
            Promotional rates aren’t the only way to save with Spectrum
            internet. Check out our Spectrum deals and promotions review for
            more ways to get a better deal with Spectrum.

            <h4>Our Spectrum internet bill</h4>
            <p>
              CableTV.com team member Manuel chose the Spectrum Internet Gig
              plan to keep him and his wife connected as they both work from
              home. Here’s what he has to say about how his internet bill
              compares to his other expenses for his Florida home:
              <br />
              “I pay about $110 a month for Spectrum internet, which isn’t
              necessarily a deal, but isn’t robbing me either. Some quick, rough
              math shows that my Spectrum service makes up about 15% of my
              typical utility bills, which I feel is an okay percentage.”

      <div className="divider">
        <p>
          Pro tip: Spectrum recently raised its download speeds for its cheapest
          two tiers, which means existing customers automatically receive faster
          internet. You might need to reset your modem first, though, which you
          can do remotely through Spectrum’s website.

            Spectrum has three internet speed tiers: up to 300 Mbps, 500 Mbps,
            and 1 Gbps** (wireless speeds may vary). These speeds and prices are
            pretty on par with most other cable providers. That said, there are
            better deals out there, depending on where you call home.

            All of Spectrum’s internet plans include a free internet modem. But
            because nothing’s totally free in life, Spectrum also offers a Wi-Fi
            router rental for $5 per month. If you want to wirelessly connect
            devices to the internet, you’ll need a router to convert the signal
            into a Wi-Fi connection. For new subscribers, Spectrum’s free modem
            is a nice convenience and removes one more thing you have to buy
            from the electronics store. But you’ll have to return the modem once
            you end Spectrum internet service. <br />
            If you’re going to stick with Spectrum for the long haul, we’d
            recommend springing for your own wireless router and modem or a
            combo Wi-Fi router/modem.
            <br />
            By buying your own router, you won’t have to pay unnecessary rental
            fees that can add up, and you can get models with faster wireless
            speeds than Spectrum would offer you. If you get your own modem, you
            can also keep it if you ever change cable internet ISPs down the
            road. If you’d like to buy your own equipment for Spectrum internet,

            <p>
              Manuel uses Spectrum’s free modem, decided to get his own Wi-Fi
              router. Here’s his experience:
              <br />
              “The Spectrum modem works just fine for me. Our hookup is in an
              indoor closet, which keeps it out of the way. It needs an
              occasional reset (probably once every six weeks or so), but I
              don’t mind that much.
              <br />
              “On the other hand, I started out using Spectrum’s Wi-Fi router
              but wasn’t a fan. I had a lot of dead spots in my home, and it
              required a lot more restarts the modem—I had to fiddle with it
              twice every week. So I switched to using two Google Nest routers,
              and I’ve had no issues since.”

            at local businesses. The access point network is{" "}

            Wi-Fi networks may be a pretty common perk for internet providers,

            Once you sign the dotted line at most ISPs, it’ll usually take a
            giant fee or more maneuvering than an Ocean’s Eleven heist to break
            your contract.
            <br />
            Spectrum doesn’t have internet contracts, so you won’t be required
            to stay with the ISP for a full year. Without contracts, you’ll have
            the flexibility to sign up for Spectrum even if you need the
            internet for only a few months, and then you can cancel without any
            early termination fees.
            <br />
            If you’re locked in an internet or TV contract with another
            provider, Spectrum will help buyout your contract up to $500◊
            through their Contract Buyout Program. To qualify for the promotion,

            <br />
            Fortunately, Spectrum has no data caps, so your household can use
            the internet without having to keep an eye on Spectrum’s data meter.
            You get to pass on the monthly 1 TB data cap and overage fees other

            To keep your kids safe on the internet, Spectrum offers subscribers
            a free Security Suite application for Windows and Apple computers.
            With Security Suite, you can block sites based on their content,
            filter adult sites from search results, set computer and web
            browsing time limits, and track your kids’ online activity.
            <br />
            On Spectrum’s email service (which is different from services like
            Gmail and Yahoo Mail), you can block emails from specific people or

            review showed that Spectrum has higher latency than providers like
            Verizon Fios, Optimum, Xfinity, and Frontier. While this may mean
            you won’t always be the quickest on the trigger, Spectrum internet

            The Federal Communications Commission recommends a minimum download
            speed of up to 25 Mbps if you’re part of a typical four- or
            five-person household. With plans that start at up to 300 Mbps
            (wireless speeds may vary), Spectrum can handle your gaming sessions
            plus everyone’s web browsing or video watching.

            If your family needs an extra boost to get internet at home, look

            household income is less than or equal to 200% of the federal
            poverty guidelines, you can get $30 per month off internet.
            <br />
            But since Spectrum’s lowest plan costs more than $30, you should
            also look into the Spectrum Internet Assist program if you want free
            internet. This program offers 30 Mbps download speeds for around
            $14.99 per month, and this offer can be paired with the ACP to make
