            NFL Sunday Ticket switched teams from DIRECTV to YouTube TV, and we

            NFL Sunday Ticket is an out-of-market sports package offered
            exclusively through YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels. It
            carries every regional out-of-market NFL game airing on Sunday
            afternoons—making it a must-have TV package for those who want the
            most live games. It’s also ideal for any football fan living in an
            area that doesn’t usually broadcast their favorite team.
            <br />
            The biggest drawbacks of NFL Sunday Ticket are its pricey plans and
            reliance on fast internet. But we’ll explain its features and
            limitations in more detail below to help you decide if NFL Sunday
            Ticket is right for you.
          </p>
          <h4>Is NFL Sunday Ticket good?</h4>
          <p>
            If you’re obsessed with the NFL, or at least a team far from home,
            then NFL Sunday Ticket is a worthy addition to any TV setup. It gets
            you over 200 live Sunday afternoon games that air regionally across
            CBS and FOX. Of course, every NFL fan would love that coverage, but
            the cost is as bulky as a defensive lineman. NFL Sunday Ticket’s
            lowest retail price is $349 for a full season, and that’s when you
            get it with YouTube TV—which already costs $72.99 a month.
            Meanwhile, similar out-of-market packages like MLB.TV and NBA League
            Pass cost way less for more live coverage. But hey, it’s the NFL
            we’re talking about—what did you expect? <br />
            At least NFL Sunday Ticket is no longer exclusive to DIRECTV with
            its lengthy contracts and bulky equipment. And, apart from its price
            and internet requirements, there are still many aspects of NFL
            Sunday Ticket to celebrate.

          <p>
            In Week 9 of the NFL season, YouTube introduced its mid-season
            pricing for NFL Sunday Ticket. All Sunday Ticket plans are 50% off
            through the end of the 2023 regular season.
            <br />
            New DIRECTV subscribers can get up to a $400 Visa Reward Card when
            signing a two-year contract and showing proof of purchase of NFL
            Sunday Ticket from YouTube.†

          </h2>
          <p className="sect-desc">
            Four NFL Sunday Ticket packages exist, with prices ranging from $174
            to $244 a season. What you pay depends on whether you sign up
            through YouTube TV or YouTube Primetime Channels and if you add NFL
            RedZone to your plan. YouTube TV offers NFL Sunday Ticket at $174
            per season. For an additional $20 per season, you can add NFL
            RedZone to your subscription. Otherwise, NFL RedZone is also
            available in YouTube TV’s Sports Plus add-on for $10.99 a month.{" "}
            <br />
            While YouTube TV offers the lowest prices for NFL Sunday Ticket,
            you’ll still pay more in the long run because of YouTube TV’s
            monthly subscription fee. The NFL regular season runs from early
            September to early January—meaning you have four months of YouTube
            TV at $72.99 a month to think about. <br />
            The benefit of NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV is that you’ll
            get every in-market NFL game and most nationally televised matchups
            in one service. (The main exception is that Thursday Night Football
            now streams on Amazon Prime Video.) <br />
            But suppose you already have a TV provider, or you’re fine with
            using a digital antenna to get your in-market and primetime games.
            In that case, getting NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube Primetime
            Channels is the better option.

            YouTube Primetime Channels is a place within YouTube where you can
            subscribe to standalone add-ons without maintaining a YouTube TV
            subscription. Starting at $224 per season, NFL Sunday Ticket is the
            most expensive Primetime Channel that YouTube offers. But it’s the
            ideal route for NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers who don’t need YouTube
            TV. <br />
            Of course, without YouTube TV in your corner, you won’t have
            immediate access to important NFL channels like CBS, FOX, ESPN, and
            NBC alongside NFL Sunday Ticket. Though, aren’t we all used to
            jumping between apps and TV inputs to watch our favorite content?{" "}
            <br />
            Ultimately, if you already have a cable, satellite, or live TV
            streaming subscription outside the YouTube family, getting NFL
            Sunday Ticket through Youtube Primetime Channels is the way to go.
            You’ll still get the same amount of live out-of-market games without
            the added commitment to YouTube TV.

            As the table above highlights, NFL Sunday Ticket offers over 200
            live NFL games per season. That’s the amount of Sunday afternoon
            out-of-market games that CBS Sports and FOX Sports air during the
            regular season. NFL+ (formerly NFL Game Pass) also has its fair
            share of live regular-season games. Its live coverage is only
            available on mobile devices and focuses on in-market and primetime
            games—not out-of-market matchups. But that still accounts for over
            150 live games at your fingertips.
            <br />
            If you don’t care about watching every game live, NFL+ Premium is an
            excellent alternative to NFL Sunday Ticket. At $14.99 a month,
            you’ll get ad-free, on-demand replays of every game after the final
            whistle and live access to NFL Network and NFL RedZone. The
            streaming service also includes archived games from past seasons and

            Apart from every live out-of-market NFL game, NFL Sunday Ticket

            You can also use the fantasy football view on mobile to sync your
            NFL Fantasy Football league with live games. <br />
            Most importantly, YouTube TV rolled out a multiview feature for
            streaming up to four video feeds simultaneously. The downside is
            that YouTube defines the available multiview combinations. In other
            words, you can’t fully customize the four feeds by selecting any
            channel you want. But at least you can still enjoy a similar mosaic
            view experience that DIRECTV supplied with its Game Mix channels.{" "}
            <br />
            The beefed-up NFL Sunday Ticket + NFL RedZone plan takes the
            features a few yards further by including the NFL RedZone channel.
            Active only on Sundays beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern, NFL RedZone
            provides live coverage of every touchdown from every Sunday
            afternoon game. Sports anchor Scott Hanson hosts the game-day

            the YouTube and YouTube TV apps are widely available. From Android
            and iOS devices to smart TVs and gaming consoles, there are many
            ways to access your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription. Just remember,
            there’s a two-screen limit when streaming NFL Sunday Ticket outside
            your home location.

          <h4>How do I get NFL Sunday Ticket? </h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            There are two main ways to sign up for NFL Sunday Ticket this
            season:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              New and existing YouTube TV subscribers can get NFL Sunday Ticket
              as an add-on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-YouTube TV subscribers can purchase NFL Sunday Ticket through
              YouTube via its Primetime Channels hub
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            No matter how you sign up, your NFL Sunday Ticket access revolves
            around your billing address. But your device’s location also plays a
            role in dictating which NFL games are available for streaming.

          <p className="sect-desc">
            NFL Sunday Ticket offers live out-of-market access on Sunday
            afternoons and is now available through YouTube TV and YouTube’s
            Primetime Channels hub. The major downside to NFL Sunday Ticket is
            its high price tag. It’s also only accessible to those with a
            high-speed internet connection, which costs extra and may not be
            available everywhere.

            If you don’t need every live matchup, we highlight other NFL viewing
            options in our How To Watch NFL Games guide. Most cable and
            satellite TV providers carry the main NFL channels. But pairing NFL+
            with an over-the-air HD antenna or an inexpensive live TV streaming
            service is one great way to tune in without breaking the bank.

          <h4>Methodology:</h4>
          <p>
            Our experts spent over two dozen hours watching and researching NFL
            Sunday Ticket on DIRECTV. Since YouTube took over the out-of-market
            package, we continued our research to determine if it’s a worthy TV
            add-on. We also compared its features and coverage to similar
            services and standard TV plans.
