            is our Editor’s Choice for best overall on-demand streaming service.
            For as low as $8.99 a month, Prime Video provides a vast library of
            content—including some pretty nice originals, like Good Omens, The
            Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and The Legend of Vox Machina—and that’s a
            bargain in today’s streaming landscape.
            <br />
            If you don’t mind some sponsored interruptions, Paramount+’s
            ad-supported plan is a great deal. For $5.99 a month, you’ll get
            access to a ton of CBS, Nickelodeon, and original content, including
            titles from the Transformers, Mission Impossible, and Star Trek
            franchises. Or you could upgrade to the $11.99 per month ad-free
            plan and get free access to SHOWTIME (previously a $10.99/month
            standalone service). But the streaming service market is vast, and
            nearly every service has at least three different plans to choose
            from. Let’s break it all down.

          <p className="sect-desc">
            On-demand streaming is no longer the cheap cable substitute that it
            once was. Almost every major streaming service raised its prices at
            least once in 2023, and several streamers are trying to cut costs by
            removing original content and/or restricting password sharing. These
            constant changes make it much harder to definitively rank each
            service, but we’re always up for a challenge. As of publishing, we
            think the best deal around is Amazon Prime Video. Its base
            $8.99-per-month price provides access to its entire library with
            (almost) no ads. You can also subscribe to most other streaming
            services through Amazon Prime Video as an add-on, making it a
            one-stop shop for the vast majority of streaming content. <br />
            The Paramount+ with SHOWTIME bundle is the next best deal. You’ll
            get access to two substantial streaming services for the price of
            one. Just be warned that Paramount+ and SHOWTIME have radically
            different libraries—the latter focusing on prestige drama and
            thrillers, and the former focusing on more family-friendly fare.{" "}
            <br />
            The Disney Bundle was once a great deal, providing access to
            Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ in one subscription. However, those prices
            are increased substantially in October, and now the highest Disney
            Bundle tier costs $24.99 per month. The standalone prices also went
            up; ad-free Disney+ and Hulu each went up by three dollars per
            month. It’s a change that now puts standalone Hulu as the single
            most expensive streaming service—more so than the previous title
            holders, Max and Netflix.

          <h4> Editor’s choice: Amazon Prime Video</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Our new favorite streaming service for 2024 is Amazon Prime Video.
            Hey, we’re as surprised as you are—but with every service committing
            to sky-high price increases, we think Amazon Prime Video is a pretty
            good deal.
            <br />
            If you’re not interested in all of the Prime membership perks, like
            free shipping, you can pick up an Amazon Prime Video subscription
            for just $8.99 a month. Unfortunately, whether or not you want the
            full membership, you’ll have to pay an extra $2.99/mo. to get rid of
            ads. This is a brand-new policy beginning in late January 2024, and
            we felt a lot better about recommending Amazon Prime Video before it
            was announced. But the streaming world moves fast and waits for no
            reviewer!
            <br />
            Even if you spring for the ad-free plan, some older licensed
            content, like The Librarian movies, 2008’s The Color of Magic
            adaptation, and Repo! The Genetic Opera, are only available through
            Freevee. Freevee is Amazon’s free ad-supported TV (FAST) streaming
            platform, and we both love and hate it.
            <br />
            We love that Freevee provides a lot of cult classics to the public
            for free, but we hate that Amazon Prime Video subscribers don’t get
            to skip the ads. Of course, you can buy any of these titles outright
            on Amazon’s Video on Demand (VOD) store, but that feels pretty
            redundant.
            <br />
            Freevee quibbles aside, though, Prime Video is a solid streaming
            service.

          <h4> Best original content library: Netflix</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Netflix, our old friend and greatest enemy. Many of us have
            subscribed to Netflix since its DVD days and look back fondly at
            Netflix originals like The Witcher and Castlevania. We’ve even
            enjoyed new additions to the service, including Netflix’s impressive
            library of mobile games like Oxenfree and Moonlighter. <br />
            But Netflix, like many streaming services in 2023, is getting
            greedy. It took a big risk this year in restricting how many people
            can access the same account, kicking many users off of their
            family’s plan. The key here is location; if you live in a different
            location than the primary account holder, you might have lost access
            to Netflix. <br />
            Ad-free account holders can buy additional members for their
            accounts for $7.99 per month, which is cheaper than every plan
            except Standard with ads. But that’s still a lot to ask of
            customers, especially since Netflix is already one of the priciest
            services on the market (surpassed only by Hulu, Max, and the Disney
            Bundle). And even this policy has restrictions; Netflix’s current
            plans only allow up to two add-on members. <br />
            We love Netflix’s content—especially its animation library—and we
            love how much entertainment it includes in just one platform. But
            it’s alienating its fanbase with these new password-sharing
            crackdowns. That, combined with its tendency to kill off shows (like
            Dead End: Paranormal Park and Warrior Nun) before their time, makes
            Netflix challenging to love.

          <h4> Best value: Paramount+ (with SHOWTIME)</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Paramount+ leveled up in 2023 by adding SHOWTIME to its premium
            tier. Subscribers can now get two streaming services for the price
            of one—a phenomenal deal compared to competitors like Max and
            Disney+. <br />
            Paramount+ offers a growing library of movies, original shows, and
            live channels. Its homepage offers hubs for CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV,
            BET, Comedy Central, and the Smithsonian Channel, although they
            could certainly be improved. The MTV hub, for example, includes a
            lot of non-MTV content, like 1929 and Tulsa King, for some reason.
            And while the Nickelodeon hub offers a variety of old shows, it
            needs more currently airing shows like Monster High. (You’ll still
            need a cable or live TV subscription for those.)
            <br />
            We like Paramount+ originals like School Spirits, Star Trek: Strange
            New Worlds, and The Good Fight, but we don’t know if we fully trust
            Paramount+ to support them. This is because we also liked Grease:
            Rise of the Pink Ladies for the minimal time it ran on the service.
            Unfortunately, it was canceled and removed from Paramount+ shortly
            after the season finale with almost no warning. It’s unclear whether
            any of the service’s other originals could suffer the same fate.
            <br />
            The platform has a surprising amount of live channels for an
            on-demand streaming service, but they may seem redundant to some
            viewers. Why watch the I Love Lucy channel when you can pick any
            episode from its library? The live channels might be more enticing
            for viewers looking for live news and sports, as they offer more
            than just what’s airing on CBS.
            <br />
            Paramount+’s biggest plus is its bundle with SHOWTIME, which has a
            very different vibe. While Paramount+ has more of a
            fun-for-the-whole-family energy, SHOWTIME is more focused on
            prestige TV and thrillers. With the SHOWTIME hub on Paramount+,
            you’ll find A24 films, boxing, and exciting originals like
            Yellowjackets and Billions.

          <h4> Best for families: Disney+</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Disney+ comes with a pretty hefty price tag for what it is, and
            that’s only somewhat softened by the Disney Bundle, which offers
            Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ for a slightly lower price. If you want the
            most affordable option, you’ll have to settle for one of its
            ad-supported plans. <br />
            So what can you get for all that money? Ignoring the price, Disney+
            is a pretty consistent streaming service. It’s super easy to
            navigate its branded hubs, and we’ve enjoyed quite a few of its
            original shows and movies. It also provides access to almost all of
            Disney’s library of content, from Snow White to Strange World. Well,
            almost. <br />
            Disney+ boasts an endless stream of Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar
            spinoffs, but it has the same trust problem as Max and Paramount+.
            In May 2023, it removed dozens of original titles from its platform
            (significantly more than its competitors, by the way) and failed to
            replace any of them with video-on-demand (VOD) listings on services
            like Google Play or Amazon Prime Video. <br />
            We’re fans of several Disney titles, but it feels like its streaming
            service should have to pick a lane. Either delete content and lower
            prices, or keep content and raise the prices. Don’t give us the
            worst of both worlds!

          <h4> Most simultaneous streams: Apple TV+</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Apple TV+ really surprised us. You wouldn’t expect Apple—the company
            that thrives on planned obsolescence and charging its customers an
            arm and a leg for every accessory—to provide a good value, but here
            we are. While Netflix and Max are super stingy about
            password-sharing, Apple TV+ allows six simultaneous streams for no
            extra cost. It’s still pretty cheap, and doesn’t even try to charge
            extra for an ad-free tier.
            <br />
            Unfortunately, Apple TV+ doesn’t have a huge library. It’s produced
            several award-winning originals, like Ted Lasso and Severance, and
            even has some charming options for kids, but doesn’t license any
            additional content from other production companies.

            like Only Murders in the Building and a surprising amount of
            Funimation anime like Trigun Stampede, but it’s a cable replacement
            at its core. Hulu is a great way for cord-cutters to catch next-day
            releases from channels like ABC and FX. Just keep in mind that other
            channel libraries may not be comprehensive as more companies claim
            content for their own streamers. <br />
            Your options will increase exponentially if you shell out the extra
            cash for Hulu + Live TV, which maybe defeats the purpose of cutting
            cable to begin with. Peacock, Paramount+, and Discovery+ are also
            great for scooping up those channels you lost when you quit cable.{" "}
            <br />
            Full disclosure, Hulu is majority owned by Disney, so it’s not
            immune to random original content purges. A moment of silence for
            everyone who never got around to watching Rosaline or The Princess.

          <h4> Best anime library: Crunchyroll</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            Crunchyroll has the best anime library of any streaming service by
            far. We’ve been running our anime simulcasts guide for a while now,
            and Crunchyroll always has the biggest section on the page. If
            you’re an anime superfan, Crunchyroll is the definitive experience
            for you.
            <br />
            The only downside to Crunchyroll is its lack of captions on English
            dubs. It’s had this problem for years now, and it’s frustrating.
            Funimation, the competitor Crunchyroll bought up in 2021, never had
            this problem. So if you’re looking for dubs for a more mainstream
            anime like Spy x Family or My Hero Academia, you might be better off
            streaming with Hulu.

            Yes, Discovery+ still exists after the HBO Max merger fiasco. If

            Its ad-supported plan is the cheapest on the market, and its ad-free

          <h4> Cheapest ad-free subscription: MGM+</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            MGM+’s main thing is movies. If you want a large, ad-free library of
            movies at your fingertips, MGM+ (previously EPIX) is the service for
            you. It’s rare to see a service with only one, low-price, ad-free
            plan in 2023, but MGM+ and Apple TV+ are both practitioners of The
            Old Ways. Unfortunately, MGM+ is also behind the times in terms of
            quality, and has yet to integrate 4K or Dolby 5.1 support.
            <br />
            Looking for shows, not movies? In recent years, MGM+ has been slowly
            building up a library of originals, including the (somewhat)
            historical dramas Domina and The Winter King. It’s not enough
            content to compete with Netflix, but there are still a few titles
            you might want to catch, including a modern reimagining of War of
            the Worlds.

            HBO Max used to be the cream of the crop, our favorite streaming
            service to recommend to all of our friends. But then the service
            started cutting off pieces of itself to sell to free, ad-supported
            television (FAST) platforms like The Roku Channel and Tubi, raised
            its prices, and merged with Discovery+ in the worst branding fiasco
            of the decade.
            <br />
            Max is a decent service for catching up on Adult Swim titles and the
            newest episodes of House of the Dragon, but we’re skeptical if it’s
            still worth the steep price, especially without new episodes
            of Succession and Barry to lean on. And if you’re looking

          <h4>ESPN+ (Exclusive live sports)</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            ESPN+ isn’t a streaming replacement for ESPN, but it’s a great
            addition to it. ESPN+ carries live content that its cable
            counterpart doesn’t, including UFC, MLS, MLB, NHL, international
            soccer, boxing, tennis, and college sports events—all for six bucks.
            <br />
            But really, ESPN+’s strength is its deep on-demand library, which
            includes every 30 for 30 documentary, and original shows
            like Peyton’s Places, In the Crease, SportsNation, and several
            others. You can even manage your fantasy league on ESPN+ and read
            exclusive analysis articles from top sportswriters.
            <br />
            Keep in mind that ESPN+ is part of the Disney suite of streaming
            services, so it’s also facing a price increase (to $10.99 a month)
            in October 2023.

        <div className="package-table-container channels">
          <h4>Does it have the content you’re looking for?</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            If you’ve quit cable and are looking for a replacement, check what
            channels each streaming service carries. For example, Discovery+ and
            Max carry shows from Food Network, TLC, HGTV, HISTORY, and
            Discovery, while Peacock carries shows from NBC, Bravo, Hallmark,
            and Telemundo. <br />
            But maybe original streaming series are your thing. You’re not alone
            on that one. Most original streaming content only sticks to its own
            platform (unless it gets sold off to a FAST service like Tubi). So
            if you’re looking for Stranger Things and Castlevania, you should go
            for Netflix, and if you’re looking for Ted Lasso and Severance, you
            should go for Apple TV+. <br />
            There are also a number of niche services that only air one type of
            content. Check out our anime, horror, and sports hubs for more
            information on how to watch your favorite niche content.

        <div className="package-table-container channels">
          <h4>Does the service offer a free trial?</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            One of the best perks of streaming TV services is the free trial
            period. The trial windows are brief (seven days is common) but offer
            enough time for a dedicated viewer to pull off a marathon or two.
            Unfortunately, not every service allows this, and most require
            credit card information, so you’ll have to be quick about hitting
            that cancellation button.

        <div className="package-table-container channels">
          <h4>How many users does it allow?</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            When we talk about simultaneous streams, we mean how many users can
            be watching content on the same account at the same time. This isn’t
            the same thing as the number of devices that can be logged in
            simultaneously, and a good plan will usually allow three or four.
            Some services offer budget plans with fewer streams. <br />
            In 2023, Netflix began restricting simultaneous log-ins based on
            location. If you live in a different household from the account
            holder, you’ll have to pay a steep fee or get booted. We haven’t
            seen too many other services follow suit yet, but it’s a big
            drawback to look out for. <br />
            And some services don’t allow for more than one profile at all,
            which is a bummer if you’re sharing an account with someone else.
            You’ll just have to keep a mental note of which One Piece episode
            you’re on if you share a Crunchyroll account.

          <h4>Does it have ads?</h4>
          <p className="after-heading">
            While the whole point of streaming was originally to escape cable’s
            relentless ads, many services now offer a cheaper ad-supported
            alternative plan to their subscribers. It’s an obvious excuse
            to raise the price of the ad-free or premium tier, which used to be
            the norm and much cheaper. We don’t love this practice, but it might
            be worth it to you if you need to save some cash. Those Disney+
            price hikes aren’t messing around.
            <br />
            Streaming service ads can be super annoying, though, especially on

          <p className="sect-desc">
            We think the best streaming platform in 2023 is,
            surprisingly, Amazon Prime Video. It offers a vast library of
            ad-free content for a reasonable price, and has avoided some of the
            more frustrating cost-cutting tactics used by its competitors (we’re
            looking at you, Netflix and Max). And its growing library of
            original content is nothing to sneeze at, either.
            <br />
            We’re also really into niche streaming services lately. Horror fans
            will love Shudder, and Crunchyroll is a must-have for anime fans.
            And if you can’t get enough reality TV, Discovery+ will be your new
            best friend.{" "}
